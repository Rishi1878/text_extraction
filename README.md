# Image Preprocessing and Text Extraction using Tesseract

This codebase utilizes OpenCV, pytesseract, and numpy libraries to preprocess images and extract text using the Tesseract OCR engine.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository


2. Install the required libraries: pytesseract opencv-python 


3. Install Tesseract OCR engine

## Usage

1. Provide the path to the image you want to process by modifying the `image_path` variable in `main.py`:

```python
image_path = 'test.png'
```


2. Run Script
```python
python main.py
```

The extracted text will be displayed on the output screen and saved in a file named processed_image.jpg.

The processed image with text will also be displayed.
